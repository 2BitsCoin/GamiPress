# GamiPress #

The most flexible and powerful gamification system for WordPress.

## Description ##

[GamiPress](https://gamipress.com "GamiPress") is the easiest way to gamify your WordPress website in just a few minutes, letting you award your users with digital rewards for interacting with your site.

Easily define the achievements, organize requirements, and choose from a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been successfully achieved.

GamiPress is extremely powerful and infinitely extensible. Check out some of the built in features:

### Many ways to define how to award the different points, achievements and ranks ###

* Completing specific other achievements, once or a specified number of times.
* Completing one or all achievements of a specified type.
* Points thresholds.
* Admin awarded achievements.
* Reaching a specific rank.
* Expending an amount of points.
