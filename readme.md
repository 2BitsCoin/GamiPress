# GamiPress #

The most flexible and powerful gamification system for WordPress.

## Description ##

[GamiPress](https://gamipress.com "GamiPress") is the easiest way to gamify your WordPress website in just a few minutes, letting you award your users with digital rewards for interacting with your site.

Easily define the achievements, organize requirements, and choose from a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been successfully achieved.

GamiPress is extremely powerful and infinitely extensible. Check out some of the built in features:

### 3 powerful ways to award your users ###

GamiPress combines three of the most powerful award systems you could add to your site:

* **Points** to automatically award your users for interacting with your site.
* **Achievements** to award users for completing all the requirements, sequentially or otherwise.
* **Ranks** to let your users climb through the ranks by completing all the rank requirements.

### Many ways to define how to award the different points, achievements and ranks ###

* Site activity (triggers based on publishing posts and pages, commenting, daily visits or logging in to your site).
* Completing specific other achievements, once or a specified number of times.
* Completing one or all achievements of a specified type.
* Points thresholds.
* Admin awarded achievements.
* Reaching a specific rank.
* Expending an amount of points.

### Unlimited Points Types ###

* Create as many types of points as you like (Credits, Gems, Coins, etc).
* Easily define how automatically your users will earn points using the 'Points Awards' tool.
* Management of each user points wallet.

### Unlimited Achievements Types ###

* Create as many types of achievement as you like (Quests, Badges, etc).
* Easily define how they relate to one another using the 'Required Steps' tool.
