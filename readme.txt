== Description ==

[GamiPress](https://gamipress.com "GamiPress") is the easiest way to gamify your WordPress website in just a few minutes, letting you award your users with digital rewards for interacting with your site.

Easily define the achievements, organize requirements, and choose from a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been successfully achieved.

GamiPress is extremely powerful and infinitely extensible. Check out some of the built in features:
